Data Science with Python: An Introduction to Linear Regression, Model Evaluation, and User Input Prediction

Welcome! This repository contains three simple programs to get you started with data science using Python. Weâ€™ll go over:

Exploring the Iris Dataset
Splitting Data for Training and Testing
Predicting Salary Using Linear Regression
1.Exploring the Iris Dataset
2.Splitting Data for Training and Testing
3.Predicting Salary Using Linear Regression

Each program is designed to introduce you to essential concepts in data science and machine learning, like loading data, splitting it into training and testing sets, training a model, evaluating its performance, and making predictions.
